# 50-projects-50-days
Following the guidance of Brad Traversy's Udemy Course, I will complete one project a day for 50 days. Although perhaps not consecutively :)

## Progress So Far
### Day 1: Expanding Cards 

In this project, collapsed panels which contain cropped images are displayed. Using Javascript, when the user clicks on
a panel, it slowly expands and presents the full image.
