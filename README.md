# 50-projects-50-days

Following the guidance of Brad Traversy's Udemy Course, I will complete one project a day for 50 days. Although perhaps not consecutively :)

## Progress So Far

### Day 1: Expanding Cards

In this project, collapsed panels which contain cropped images are displayed. Using Javascript, when the user clicks on
a panel, it slowly expands and presents the full image.

###### `Originally Completed: 8/7/2021`

### Day 2: Progress Steps

A basic progress bar that adjusts to whichever "Step" in a fictitious process the user is on. The user can move onto the next step via a button, as well as return to the previous step -- and the progress bar and other styling adjust accordingly.

### Day 3: Rotating Navigation

Demonstrates how to hide a navigation menu until the user clicks an "open" icon. Once clicked, the main content of the webpage rotates, revealing the once-hidden navigation menu.

###### `Originally Completed: 8/9/2021`

### Day 4: Hidden Search Widget

A simple "Search" widget. The user can click on the search icon, at which point an input box slowly stretches out from the icon, allowing them to type in it. They can click
the icon again to close the input box.
