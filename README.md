# 50-projects-50-days

Following the guidance of Brad Traversy's Udemy Course, I will complete one project a day for 50 days. Although perhaps not consecutively :)

## Progress So Far

### Day 1: Expanding Cards

In this project, collapsed panels which contain cropped images are displayed. Using Javascript, when the user clicks on
a panel, it slowly expands and presents the full image.

### Day 2: Progress Steps

A basic progress bar that adjusts to whichever "Step" in a fictitious process the user is on. The user can move onto the next step via a button, as well as return to the previous step -- and the progress bar and other styling adjust accordingly.

### Day 3: Rotating Navigation

Demonstrates how to hide a navigation menu until the user clicks an "open" icon. Once clicked, the main content of the webpage rotates, revealing the once-hidden navigation menu.
